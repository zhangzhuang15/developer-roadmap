# Assertion errors

It's very easy to see this type of error, just follow these steps:
1. open your terminal app in your local machine, such as "Terminal" in macOS;
2. run `node` (if you don't install node, recommend you to install it by `nvm`; run `brew install nvm` in macOS);
3. just run   `assert(1 === 2)`;
